    The currency of money is the constant and monotonous repetition of the same process. The
    commodity is always in the hands of the seller; the money, as a means of purchase, always in the
    hands of the buyer. And money serves as a means of purchase by realising the price of the
    commodity. This realisation transfers the commodity from the seller to the buyer and removes the
    money from the hands of the buyer into those of the seller, where it again goes through the same
    process with another commodity. That this one-sided character of the money’s motion arises out
    of the two-sided character of the commodity’s motion, is a circumstance that is veiled over. The
    very nature of the circulation of commodities begets the opposite appearance. The first
    metamorphosis of a commodity is visibly, not only the money’s movement, but also that of the
    commodity itself; in the second metamorphosis, on the contrary, the movement appears to us as
    the movement of the money alone. In the first phase of its circulation the commodity changes
    place with the money. Thereupon the commodity, under its aspect of a useful object, falls out of
    circulation into consumption.27 In its stead we have its value-shape – the money. It then goes
    through the second phase of its circulation, not under its own natural shape, but under the shape
    of money. The continuity of the movement is therefore kept up by the money alone, and the same
    movement that as regards the commodity consists of two processes of an antithetical character, is,
    when considered as the movement of the money, always one and the same process, a continued
    change of places with ever fresh commodities. Hence the result brought about by the circulation
    of commodities, namely, the replacing of one commodity by another, takes the appearance of
    having been effected not by means of the change of form of the commodities but rather by the
    money acting as a medium of circulation, by an action that circulates commodities, to all
    appearance motionless in themselves, and transfers them from hands in which they are non-usevalues, to hands in which they are use-values; and that in a direction constantly opposed to the
    direction of the money. The latter is continually withdrawing commodities from circulation and
    stepping into their places, and in thus way continually moving further and further from its
    starting-point. Hence although the movement of the money is merely the expression of the
    circulation of commodities, yet the contrary appears to be the actual fact, and the circulation of
    commodities seems to be the result of the movement of the money.28
    Again, money functions as a means of circulation only because in it the values of commodities
    have independent reality. Hence its movement, as the medium of circulation, is, in fact, merely
    the movement of commodities while changing their forms. This fact must therefore make itself
    plainly visible in the currency of money. Thus the linen for instance, first of all changes its
    commodity-form into its money-form. The second term of its first metamorphosis, C–M, the
    money form, then becomes the first term of its final metamorphosis, M–C, its re-conversion into
    the Bible. But each of these two changes of form is accomplished by an exchange between
    commodity and money, by their reciprocal displacement. The same pieces of coin come into the
    seller’s hand as the alienated form of the commodity and leave it as the absolutely alienable form
    of the commodity. They are displaced twice. The first metamorphosis of the linen puts these coins
    into the weaver’s pocket, the second draws them out of it. The two inverse changes undergone by
    the same commodity are reflected in the displacement, twice repeated, but in opposite directions,
    of the same pieces of coin.
