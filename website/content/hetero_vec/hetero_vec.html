  I made this rust crate, which I think is pretty cool. It stores
  dynamically sized types in a dense vector. It was fun to make.

  I'm hoping that will help me improve cache performance in future projects.

  I don't have much to add right now, beyond what I've written in the docs.
  So check those out :)
