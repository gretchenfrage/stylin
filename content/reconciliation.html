      <p class="c11"><span class="c19 c22">5/21/18</span></p>
      <p class="c21"><span class="c15">Reconciliation</span></p>
      <p class="c21 c6"><span class="c15"></span></p>
      <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I love you,&quot; says the image of my sister, her voice warm and sincere and hurting from distance.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I hope you&#39;ll visit soon,&quot; she adds, with less warmth and more pain and just as much sincerity.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The statement catches me off guard. I freeze for a moment, staring at her image. I wish it was some hologram, or even a flat display. Anything that wouldn&#39;t feel so real, only to vanish as quickly as it appears. But the image is perfect on account of not existing at all, nothing but nerve signals pulsed into my brain by the Interface.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Take care,&quot; I respond, avoiding a discussion I don&#39;t want to have and a promise that I know I couldn&#39;t keep.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will the call to end. The Interface hears my thought and her image blinks out with a short chiming note.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I breathe out a defeated sigh. I close my eyes to listen and think. My breath whispers in and out of my nose. My heart beats rhythmically, shockwaves of blood pulsing up my neck and into my ears. I brush my hands against my soft, smooth, synthetic jeans as its smart fibers clean themselves of the sweat which rubbed off my fingers. The Alcubierre-Wendt engine hums in many low and high frequencies, strong and steady like a workhorse as it bends spacetime around my transport.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="c3"><span class="c19">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c8">Why find loopholes in the laws of our universe if we&#39;re just going to use them to get further away from each other?</span>
      </p>
      <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No answer appears.</span></p>
      <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Show me home,&quot; I speak out loud, my eyes still closed. The dark-pink phantasms behind my eyelids fall away to reveal my family&#39;s home by the forest. The humanly imperfect cuts of the criss-crossed eidlerwood logs tell the story of my mother constructing the cabin in the ancient tradition of metal tools. I turn around and feel the warm wind brush over my skin from the forest of massive, lush trees under which fauna, most native but some from Earth, enjoy their simple life. </span>
      </p>
      <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember when I was a child and I found the cabin to be antiquated and amish and I pitied the simple creatures of the forest. I understand now that those beasts are more happy and innocent than humans will ever be again. I wonder whether I would still be out here if I had realized that sooner.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I open my eyes, vanishing the forest, the cabin, the warm wind, the smell of grass, the chirping birds, the sun on my face. I stand in my transport in the engine room, electrical channels and mass inverters arching around the room before consolidating in the glowing white box in the middle of the back wall. I walk forward and up the steep, knurled, metal staircase into the cabin. The silver painted-maroon walls arch around me forming a humble-sized living room decorated with paintings and photos and wooden trinkets. I look to the left through the window and into space at thousands of foreign constellations. Their brilliance is beautiful but without a horizon they lose their effect faster than old sci-fi characters would leave you to believe.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I walk to the right to the pantry, and I will a coffee to form. The reconfigurator starts humming as it produces a glowing white amorphous orb of matter which spends a minute taking the shape and molecular structure of something not entirely unlike a ceramic mug of black coffee. I take a sip, and I feel comforted.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I walk to the corner of the room where an armchair rests and I sink into its familiar leather. The leather holds itself together strongly but wears scratches and scuffs from years of use from myself and my mother before me. I take note of these scuffs whenever I sit because they say as clear as writing that the leather is real and dead and will not heal nor clean itself. I remember when my mother first bought the chair and I was thirteen and I didn&#39;t understand why she would do such a thing.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Mom,&quot; I asked with a hint of rising inflection.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Alice,&quot; she responded playfully, moving the chair across our hardwood floor to a place where it would look over the forest.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Why did you buy that? It&#39;s handmade and crude. It&#39;s rough and it&#39;ll wear and stain and you&#39;ll just have to fix it and clean it and throw it away.&quot;</span>
      </p>
      <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It&#39;s not supposed to take care of itself. That&#39;s what animals do. Dead things don&#39;t heal, don&#39;t clean themselves.&quot;</span>
      </p>
      <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Why not? It&#39;s easier... in every way.&quot;</span></p>
      <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She stopped and paused.</span></p>
      <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Alice, how do you feel about your pants?&quot;</span></p>
      <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question caught me off guard.</span></p>
      <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I don&#39;t know. Nothing. They&#39;re pants. They&#39;re comfortable and they work. They clean and fix themselves. I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t care about them.&quot;</span>
      </p>
      <p class="c3"><span
          class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;And how do you feel about your bed?&quot; she continued.</span></p>
      <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Uh, it works,&quot; I answered. &quot;It&#39;s soft and it cleans and fixes itself. It keeps itself exactly as soft and cool as I enjoy it.&quot;</span>
      </p>
      <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Mmhm,&quot; she said, as if she expected me to understand something. &quot;That&#39;s the world we&#39;ve built for ourselves. The world works. It cleans and fixes itself and we don&#39;t have to do any work. It hears our thoughts and makes itself exactly how we want it.&quot;</span>
      </p>
      <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She paused, then continued.</span></p>
      <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;This chair, this cabin, they&#39;re more interesting. They won&#39;t work for you, you get out what you put in. If you want them clean, you clean them. If you want them pristine, you repair them. And when you rest at the end of the day, you learn to appreciate the way they are, and the work you did to get that. That&#39;s how we&#39;ve lived life for a million years, and that&#39;s how we&#39;re supposed to do it.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I rest in the chair, feeling the wooden carvings on the arms with my hands as I mull over that wisdom as if it were a piece of chocolate. I miss her.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="c3"><span class="c19">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c8">How close am I</span><span class="c19">, I wonder. </span><span
          class="c8">Twenty minutes away</span><span class="c2">, the Interface lets me know. No words are exchanged.</span></p>
      <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I sluggishly stand and walk out of the front of the living room and into the helm. Metal-framed windows arc from the body of the ship into a cockpit in the shape of a toucan&#39;s beak. I rest my hands on the back of the white, polymeroid seat and look forward at the red star I am approaching. I continue sipping my coffee.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="c3 c6"><span class="c2"></span></p>
      <p class="c3 c9"><span class="c2">The transport&#39;s humming drops an octave as the engine releases its claws from spacetime and drifts forward at sublight speeds. It descends to the orbiting platform with strength and precision and gentleness and locks into a hover a few inches above the ground. The platform spans for a kilometer in each direction, its metal octagonal face forming a matte reflector of what warm red light passes through the habitat bubble. Under the platform the planet rages as hot as a blast furnace, spewing acid rain and deadly sandstorms and casting bolts of lightning that would put Thor to shame.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="c3 c9"><span class="c8">If Dante&#39;s Inferno is real, I&#39;m standing over it</span><span class="c2">.</span></p>
      <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I descend the rubbery ladder on the side of my ship and step foot on the platform. I turn around to see a young man walking towards me. </span>
      </p>
      <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I&#39;m glad you could make it, Alice,&quot; he says, his voice loud and welcoming.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="c3 c9"><span class="c2">His short yet curly dark-blonde hair sits like a helmet atop his rectangular head. He smiles at me, baring his rounded teeth and stretching his pale skin from his from his chin to his cheeks, forming dimples on either side of his pale pink lips. His dark eyes look directly into mine, failing to be framed by either his thin blonde eyebrows or his nonexistent eyelashes.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Thank you for reaching out to me,&quot; I respond, because it&#39;s polite and flattering and I know the importance of having good relations when so far from home. </span>
      </p>
      <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Come with me, I&#39;ll check you in,&quot; he states in a factual and practiced tone. </span>
      </p>
      <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turns away from me and begins walking to one of several buildings that rest on the platform. The building stands tall and gray and rectangular with grids of tinted windows, almost brutalist but lacking the geometric beauty of brutalism.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You weren&#39;t very specific about what I&#39;m here for,&quot; I tell him as I catch up to walk beside him.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I&#39;m sorry about that, the research this facility conducts is classified. Would you remind me what I&#39;ve told you so far?&quot; he responds.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You&#39;ve detected certain characteristics in my neurophysiology and you want me to come to do some research studies,&quot; I respond. &quot;And that you&#39;ll pay me 5000 coins,&quot; I add.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;That&#39;s correct,&quot; he states, with nothing to suggest that he intends to say more.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We approach a double door at the base of the tower which consists of two plates of inertia-enhanced alloy as thick as my wrist locking into each other in a hexagonal zig-zag. The man snaps his fingers and the doors begin pulling themselves apart, struggling like a beach-goer walking through a knee-deep tide. We walk through the doorway and into a spacious and barren room illuminated by bright, cool lights. </span>
      </p>
      <p class="c3"><span class="c19">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c8">What&#39;s his name again? </span><span
          class="c2">I ask the Interface.</span></p>
      <p class="c3"><span class="c19">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c8">Query rejected</span><span class="c2">, it responds.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="c3"><span class="c19">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c8">Huh?</span><span
          class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span
          class="c8">For his name? His name is classified?</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;I am shocked.</span></p>
      <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I&#39;m sorry, could you remind me of your name?&quot; I ask him.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="c3"><span
          class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Huh,&quot; he chuckles. &quot;You can call me Michael.&quot;</span></p>
      <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of the room rests a scanning ring, a loop of glowing blue polymer on the floor, twice my height in diameter, and mirrored twice my height above on a silver cylinder extruding from the ceiling. Michael steps into the rings. </span>
      </p>
      <p class="c3 c9"><span
          class="c2">The rings flash bright and make a chiming note before announcing, &quot;verified identity, Michael.&quot;</span>
      </p>
      <p class="c3 c9"><span class="c2">I step into the rings and they flash and chime and announce, &quot;verified identity, Alice Bard.&quot;</span>
      </p>
      <p class="c3 c9"><span class="c2">&quot;Shuttle bay,&quot; he commands.</span></p>
      <p class="c3 c9"><span class="c19">The circle we stand on descends into the floor, then begins to move sideways, becoming an elevator. </span>
      </p>
      <p class="c3 c9"><span class="c2">&quot;So what&#39;s the study?&quot; I ask him.</span></p>
      <p class="c3 c9"><span class="c2">&quot;We&#39;re doing an experiment on state reconciliation,&quot; he responds.</span></p>
      <p class="c3 c9"><span class="c8">State reconciliation, </span><span class="c19">I think, </span><span class="c8 c12 c25">yeah, like in primary school computation sciences. What was it about? I didn&#39;t really retain much from that class.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="c3 c9"><span class="c2">&quot;Remind me what that is?&quot; I ask.</span></p>
      <p class="c3 c9"><span class="c2">&quot;The compute net is based on state reconciliation,&quot; he begins in a practiced tone, looking forward at the coldly lit wall. &quot;The compute net relies on a massive amount of constantly changing state,&quot; he continues. &quot;Orders for goods and services, public and private records, astronomical scans, remote calls, the list goes on. All of this state, this data, is constantly changing, and constantly being used. The tricky part is that this state is stored on many compute centers across the galaxy, usually redundantly.&quot;</span>
      </p>
      <p class="c3 c9"><span class="c2">&quot;For reliability?&quot; I ask.</span></p>
      <p class="c3 c9"><span class="c2">&quot;Yes, and also for dividing up work. At any given moment, there&#39;s billions of humans accessing great amounts of data from, for example, the central library. Imagine if one computer had to handle all those requests. It would be overloaded,&quot; he responds.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="c3 c9"><span class="c19">&quot;Hm,&quot; I vocalize. </span><span class="c8 c12 c25">That sounds familiar.</span></p>
      <p class="c3 c9"><span class="c2">The elevator lowers itself into a bay, a boxy bubble of metal-framed windows hanging from underneath the platform like a zeppelin. The room stretches long and narrow, populated only by an array of ten bronze cylinders reaching from the ceiling to the floor at the long edge of the room, similar in size to the elevator. Michael snaps his fingers and the nearest cylinder slides open a panel, forming a doorway and revealing a gravity shuttle nested neatly inside. We walk into the shuttle and the door closes and we begin accelerating to the planet&#39;s fiery surface.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="c3 c9"><span class="c2">I ask, &quot;how do the computers keep their copies of their state the same between them, if they&#39;re each editing their version of the state simultaneously in different ways?&quot;</span>
      </p>
      <p class="c3 c9"><span class="c2">&quot;The state has to be reconciled. That is to say, they need to communicate with each other to merge their edits into a synchronized state that incorporates all modifications in a reasonable way. That&#39;s state reconciliation,&quot; he responds. &quot;The compute net is still evolving, and so we&#39;re still finding ways to improve state reconciliation techniques.&quot;</span>
      </p>
      <p class="c3 c9"><span class="c8">Ok, that makes sense. But what do they need me for? </span><span class="c2">I wonder.</span></p>
      <p class="c3 c9"><span class="c2">I look through the panoramic windows at the hellscape around me as we descend to the surface. The sky glows maroon, the landscape splays its rocky hills and canyons as far as I can see through the heat mirage. We pass through a beige cloud which crackles with lightning, and the shuttle&#39;s windows hiss like a pan boiling off water as they fight the cloud&#39;s acid breath. A bolt of light and thunder hits our shuttle, encompassing us momentarily in a bright white void as the windows darken themselves in reaction.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="c3 c9"><span class="c2">A small complex stands beneath us, defying its surroundings like a medieval castle and constructed with resemblance to one. Its light-silver surfaces connect in beveled right angles, composing several stubby towers and reticulated passages. Our shuttle descends into a tower and the wind and thunder of the planet grow silent, the red sunlight replaced with glowing white polymeroid strips. The shuttle door slides open to reveal a granite tile hallway. An older man stands in the middle.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="c3 c9"><span class="c2">He glances at me, then locks eyes with Michael. &quot;Hello Michael. Is everything well?&quot; he asks, his voice deep and gravelly.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="c3 c9"><span class="c2">&quot;Hello Grant,&quot; Michael responds, &quot;everything is well. Are we ready?&quot;</span></p>
      <p class="c3 c9"><span class="c2">&quot;Yes, everything is ready,&quot; Grant responds.</span></p>
      <p class="c3 c9"><span class="c2">I take a moment to study him closer. He stands a few inches taller than Michael, and appears significantly older. His pale skin stretches over his face like a theater mask, dotted by age spots and concaving inwards over his cheeks and lips and eyes. His bright white hair diverges from a clear part and neatly curves over his head. His eyebrows and eyelashes have aged away, highlighting his gray-irised eyes which do not look at me.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="c3 c9"><span class="c2">&quot;Follow me,&quot; Michael says as he glances at me and gestures with his hand for me to follow him down the hallway. </span>
      </p>
      <p class="c3 c9"><span class="c2">I follow him through a silver door into a small room as Grant walks behind me. The room&#39;s faces form a perfect cube, the walls and ceiling and floor each covered by a grid of ten by ten matte panels which glow soft gray. The room lies empty except for a bed in the middle. The bed would provide no rest nor comfort; it simply consists of a bare foam mattress on a black metal box which rests flush with the floor and reaches as high as my waist.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="c3 c9"><span class="c2">Michael looks at me and says, &quot;you&#39;ll want to lie down.&quot;</span></p>
      <p class="c3 c9"><span class="c2">My heart beats quickly with anxiety, like it would when I went to my doctor as a child.</span></p>
      <p class="c3 c9"><span class="c8">Calm down</span><span class="c19">, I tell myself, </span><span
          class="c8">you&#39;re at a government facility.</span></p>
      <p class="c3 c9"><span class="c2">I lie on the bed and sink into its cool foam. </span></p>
      <p class="c3 c9"><span class="c2">Michael says, &quot;you&#39;ll need to give us Interface permissions so we can begin.&quot;</span></p>
      <p class="c3 c9"><span class="c19">The Interface makes a chiming note and I hear the words, </span><span class="c8 c12 c25">root access request from verified institution: Arcadian Remote Neurology Center.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="c3 c9"><span class="c2">I pause for a second, then accept the request.</span></p>
      <p class="c3 c9"><span class="c2">Michael says, &quot;thank you Alice. Let&#39;s begin.&quot;</span></p>
      <p class="c3 c9"><span class="c2">Grant states a simple command, &quot;branch.&quot;</span></p>
      <p class="c3 c9"><span class="c2">I wave of dizziness washes over me from the back of my skull to the tips of my limbs. My vision blurs and darkens. My eyelids grow heavy, and I drift into unconsciousness.</span>

      <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well, I think it was red or blue,&quot; I respond.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Michael nods, and tells me, &quot;I want you to close your eyes, and remember the room as blue.&quot;</span>
      </p>
      <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Okay,&quot; I respond.</span></p>

      </p>
      <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I close my eyes again and mentally replace the blue walls with red ones. I see the card, and I see the number four written on its face.</span>

      <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Thank you,&quot; Michael says. He turns to face Grant and says, &quot;tell me when you&#39;re finished collecting the data.&quot;</span>
      </p>
      <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grant nods once. His stands like a statue for a minute as his eyes dart back and forth over some non-existent floating image that the Interface is showing him. His eyes focus back on Michael and he says, &quot;very successful. The data is clear, the neural response is positive.&quot; He speaks a hair faster than he did before, his tone shifting from boredom to mild satisfaction.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Very good,&quot; Michael responds. He glances at me and smiles, once again baring his rounded teeth, before looking back at Grant. &quot;Then I think we should try phase two,&quot; he finishes. He looks back to me, no longer smiling, and tells me, &quot;you should lie back down.&quot;</span>
      </p>
      <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Okay,&quot; I tell him. I rest myself back into the cool foam. My headache is hurting less.</span>

      <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once again a pain shoots through my head. My vision blurs and blooms bright, and I shut my eyes. I feel myself losing consciousness, and I let myself drift into darkness.</span>

      <p class="c0 c6"><span class="c2"></span></p>

      <p class="c3"><span class="c5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;then subsides. My vision is clearer, and painfully brighter. My headache pounds hard with the nervous beating of my heart. </span><span
          class="c4">Are you still there? </span><span class="c5">I do not hear a response. </span><span

      <p class="c3"><span class="c7 c5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Increase branch level,&quot; Grant commands.</span></p>
      <p class="c3"><span class="c7 c5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My vision blurs so much that I can barely see. My headache burns coldly, and the burning crawls down my spine. I feel my heart beat spastickly with adrenaline, but seemingly in slow motion. It contracts slowly, as if struggling like the doors on the entrance, before expanding a second later. In fact, everything except my thoughts seem to be moving through in slow motion: my breathing, my eyes blinking, Michael and Grant&#39;s movement.</span>

          class="c5">, I think, </span><span class="c4">don&#39;t panic.</span><span class="c7 c5">&nbsp;I close my eyes and draw in a deep breath which seems to last forever. With the sterile air flowing into my body, I reflect on the strangeness and scariness of the situation. I hold the breath for what feels like minutes, then slowly exhale. With the now-warm air exiting my lungs, I release my fear and anxiety.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="c3 c9"><span class="c4">Show me home,</span><span class="c7 c5">&nbsp;I think to the Interface.</span></p>
      <p class="c3 c9"><span class="c4">Action denied, </span><span class="c7 c5">it responds.</span></p>
      <p class="c3 c9"><span class="c4">That&#39;s okay, </span><span class="c5">I think. </span><span
          class="c4">It&#39;s better to imagine it.</span><span class="c7 c5">&nbsp;I visualize myself sinking into my mother&#39;s leather chair. I mentally construct the eidlerwood log walls around me, decorated with odd wooden trinkets and my sister&#39;s paintings. I picture the panoramic windows in front of me looking over the ancient forest. </span>
      </p>
      <p class="c3 c9"><span class="c4">Action denied,</span><span class="c7 c5">&nbsp;the Interface tells me unprompted.</span></p>
      <p class="c3 c9"><span class="c4">That&#39;s weird,</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;I think. </span><span class="c4 c12">This whole thing is weird. That&#39;s okay, things get weird sometimes. Just don&#39;t panic.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="c3 c9"><span class="c4">Action denied, </span><span class="c5">the Interface repeats. </span><span class="c4 c12">Action deni&#8210; Warning, several Interface kernel errors occurred. Action denied. Action denied. Action de&#8210; Warning, many Interface kernel errors occurred.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="c3"><span class="c4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c7 c5">The Interface suddenly feels different. The Interface is not supposed to feel intrusive. It feels like an imaginary friend, who will listen to your thoughts, and respond to them with its own simple, synthetic thoughts. However, in this moment, the Interface feels like it is panicking. Its thoughts are noisy and uncomposed, as if it is struggling to function.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="c3"><span class="c5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">Don&#39;t mind that, </span><span
          class="c5">I think. </span><span class="c4">Just don&#39;t panic. Imagine the forest.</span></p>
      <p class="c3"><span class="c7 c5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I pick an old, massive tree that I would always play around as a child, and I try to remember its details. Its branches reach eighty feet into the air, and its roots eighty feet into the ground.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="c3"><span class="c7 c5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, I feel as if something in the Interface has snapped, as if it were a branch that I leaned on too hard. The darkness of my eyelids and the intangible images I have constructed fall away to reveal the Interface&#39;s accurate and immersive simulation of the room in the cabin. However, the simulation feels different from every other time I asked to see home. I feel like I&#39;m actually in my mother&#39;s cabin, and no longer in the gray room in the research center. I can no longer feel the burning in my nerves nor the numbness in my limbs. </span>
      </p>
      <p class="c3"><span class="c5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hear footsteps walking up behind me. </span><span class="c4">That&#39;s weird, </span><span
          class="c5">I think, </span><span class="c4">these simulations aren&#39;t supposed to have people in them. </span><span class="c5">Yet, when I look to my left, I see my sister standing beside me, looking out the window. She looks younger than she is now, probably seventeen. She turns to look at me, and I realize that I&#39;ve been here before. </span><span
          class="c4 c12">Is this a memory? Why is the Interface showing me one of my memories? Can it even do that?</span></p>
      <p class="c3"><span class="c4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c7 c5">We were, in fact, seventeen. Earlier that night our mother had been diagnosed.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="c3"><span class="c7 c5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My sister turned to look at me. &quot;Well...&quot; she said. &quot;Five to ten years. And she&#39;ll be gone.&quot;</span>
      </p>
      <p class="c3"><span class="c7 c5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She turned to face the window again and we watched the forest in silence for a minute. The insects chirped outside as the sun set.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="c3"><span class="c7 c5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yeah,&quot; I finally responded. I could produce no better reaction. We stood for another minute.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="c3"><span class="c5 c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What are you going to do when you&#39;re finally eighteen?&quot; She asked. &quot;You going to buy a transport and fly off into deep space like you always wanted?&quot;</span>
      </p>
      <p class="c3"><span class="c7 c5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yeah,&quot; I answered.</span></p>
      <p class="c3"><span class="c7 c5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She turned to look at me again. &quot;Are you serious? Mother&#39;s dying and you&#39;re gonna spend her last years flying as far away from her as you can?&quot;</span>
      </p>
      <p class="c3"><span class="c7 c5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shock I had felt from the news turned into anger. I looked away from the forest and into her eyes. &quot;Yes, Adamina!&quot; I shouted. &quot;You know why? Because I don&#39;t wanna end up like her! I don&#39;t wanna spend my whole life in some cabin on some amish planet chopping wood and painting birds and then get sick and die! There are stars out there! Other planets! And we have ships that can bring us to them! I&#39;m not going to spend my whole life on some nowhere planet!&quot; I began to cry.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="c3"><span class="c7 c5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She continued to look at me for a moment, then looked down. &quot;I knew,&quot; she said defeatedly. She turned around and walked back into the house.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="c3"><span class="c7 c5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The memory, or simulation, or whatever it is, vanishes, leaving me back on the foam bed staring at the back of my eyelids.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="c3"><span class="c7 c5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hear Grant repeat, &quot;increase branch level.&quot;</span>
      </p>
      <p class="c3"><span class="c24">&gt; interface log warning: phi signal is noisy, logging errors may occur</span></p>
      <p class="c3"><span class="c5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time seems to slow more. I can no longer perceive the beating of my heart, nor my breathing. In fact, I can not even feel my body, nor hear anything, nor even see the dark pink stars behind my eyelids. </span><span
          class="c4">Stay calm, </span><span class="c5">I remind myself, </span><span class="c4">meditate.</span><span class="c7 c5">&nbsp;I try to focus on my thoughts. I feel nervous. I imagine myself breathing in, holding that breath, and then exhaling my stress.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="c3"><span class="c7 c5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel some other source of thoughts, one that is neither me nor the Interface. It feels human, but it is not myself. </span>
      </p>
      <p class="c3 c9"><span class="c4">Who are you? </span><span class="c7 c5">I mentally ask it.</span></p>
      <p class="c3 c9"><span class="c4">Michael Newcastle</span><span class="c7 c5">, it responds. The response feels simple, as if it were a subconscious reaction by this entity.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="c3 c9"><span class="c4 c12">Michael? Am I... am I interfacing with Michael&#39;s mind?</span></p>
      <p class="c3 c9"><span class="c7 c5">I feel a second external source of thoughts.</span></p>
      <p class="c3 c9"><span class="c4">Who are you?</span><span class="c7 c5">&nbsp;I mentally repeat.</span></p>
      <p class="c3 c9"><span class="c4">Grant Oldfort, </span><span class="c7 c5">it responds.</span></p>
      <p class="c3 c9"><span class="c4">Huh,</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;I react. </span><span class="c4 c12">Weird. I guess I really am connected to their minds. I&#39;m scared. I wish I could talk to my sister.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="c3 c9"><span class="c7 c5">I feel the mental presences of Michael and Grant vanish, and a third take their place.</span></p>
      <p class="c3 c9"><span class="c4">And who are you? </span><span class="c7 c5">I mentally ask.</span></p>
      <p class="c3 c9"><span class="c4">Huh? </span><span class="c5">It responds. This response feels more aware than the subconscious reactions of Grant and Michael. </span><span
          class="c4 c12">I&#39;m Adamina Bard. What&#39;s going on?</span></p>
      <p class="c3 c9"><span class="c4">What? </span><span class="c5">I react. </span><span
          class="c4 c12">Sister? Am I really talking to you? How?</span></p>
      <p class="c3 c9"><span class="c5">She responds, </span><span class="c4 c12">Is that you, Alice?</span></p>
      <p class="c3 c9"><span class="c7 c5">I feel a sharp pain stab deep into my head. I feel myself losing consciousness.</span></p>
      <p class="c3 c9"><span class="c4 c12">I&#39;m sorry, Ada.</span></p>
      <p class="c3 c9"><span class="c7 c5">A moment passes.</span></p>

      <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I would consider the results of our 13th trial very successful. The subject experienced, by far, the most positive response to the branching and reconciliation, and continued to survive for 230 ms after the second increase in branching level. This shows clear improvement in the branching technologies, and definitely prompts further studies. I&#39;ll be sending these results to our benefactors tonight.</span>

        I wrote this story in my last semester of high school. This was safely the best
        piece of writing I'd created at that point. Our teacher was a fantastic and kind
        man who respected us and encouraged us to do our best.
